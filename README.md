# Auto Mail ![](https://i.imgur.com/fe85aVR.png)

The Auto Mail is an open-source automated email sending application that enables easy mass email sending. With just a few configurations, you can define an email with a standard subject and text, which can also include attachments, and effortlessly send them to a predefined contact list. The project is built using Node.js and is part of my attempt to create projects that cater to my everyday needs.

2. In the same "config" folder, place the text you wish to send in the email in the "text.txt" file.

4. If you have email attachments, place the attachment files in the "attachments" folder within the project.

Important

* It is necessary to have a Google account for the proper functioning of the application. 

* To ensure the application works correctly, the configuration and attachment files should be placed in their respective folders. In the case of configuration files, they should not be deleted to maintain the application's functionality.
