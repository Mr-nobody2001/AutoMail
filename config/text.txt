Dear F,

I would like to express my sincere interest in joining the team as an intern in the software development area. As a technology enthusiast, I am eager to collaborate on real projects and apply the knowledge I have acquired over the years.

Currently, I am a full-stack programmer with a focus on backend development, using languages like Java and Node.js. I also have experience in frontend development with JavaScript. My skills extend beyond application development, as I also have knowledge in networking and information security, which can be beneficial in various aspects of technology projects.

Furthermore, I have experience working with Artificial Intelligence (AI) APIs, and I would like to draw your attention to my most recent project on GitHub, where I created a language learning program with AI. This project demonstrates my ability to apply cutting-edge technology to solve real-world problems and my passion for exploring new possibilities through AI.

It would be an honor and an incredible opportunity to be a part of the team. I am looking forward to learning from the talented professionals at your company and contributing my enthusiasm, technical skills, and dedication to achieving project goals.

I am available for an interview to discuss how my experience and skills can be beneficial to your team and ongoing projects.

Sincerely,

Mr. Nobody.
